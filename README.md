## A Hierarchical Resampling Package for Python

Version 1.1.3

hierarch is a package for hierarchical resampling (bootstrapping, permutation) of datasets in Python. Because for loops are ultimately intrinsic to cluster-aware resampling, hierarch uses Numba to accelerate many of its key functions.

hierarch has several functions to assist in performing resampling-based (and therefore distribution-free) hypothesis tests, confidence interval calculations, and power analyses on hierarchical data.

## Introduction 

Design-based randomization tests represents the platinum standard for significance analyses [[1, 2, 3]](#1) - that is, they produce probability statements that depend only on the experimental design, not at all on less-than-verifiable assumptions about the probability distributions of the data-generating process. Researchers can use hierarch to quickly perform automated design-based randomization tests for experiments with arbitrary levels of hierarchy.
